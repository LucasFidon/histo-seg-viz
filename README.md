# Visualization tool for slide segmentation

## Usage
You can visualize an image with several segmentations overlaid on the image using
```bash
cd histo-seg-viz
python main.py -i <path-to-image> -s <path-to-segmentation-1> <path-to-segmentation2> ... <path-to-segmentationN>
```
Each segmentation will be displayed independently on the input image in different columns.
